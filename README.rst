Tanay's Blog
============

This contains all the blogs that I write. I've chosen to write them in
RST and Sphinx and to store them in a completely different repository. This will be
imported by my personal website and used to render the blog pages within it.

To install Sphinx on Ubuntu:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python-sphinx

In order to generate HTML build in ``build/html``

.. code:: bash

    make html

In order to generate JSON build to be used by the webstie in ``build/json``

.. code:: bash

    make json
